# Interactive Basketball Roster

## Overview

This is one of my first personal projects. The goal is to showcase the different languages I have learned over the years. The Interactive Basketball Roster is a program that allows you to keep up with your basketball team. All-in-one place to access player information, stats, and analysis. The program is built with a React front-end and a Python backend using Flask.
